Description

I had a counter top in need of a hook. So, I made a hook in need of a counter top. What can I say? It's love.

Instructions

1. Print (default settings work super dooper)
2. Attach rubber foot (same rubber foot on the bottom of your MakerBot)
2. Hang

For strongest hook, print it at 100% infill (duh).

Note: SketchUp file provided so you can bend it to your will.
